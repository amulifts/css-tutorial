<!-- Experiment with CSS pseudo-classes such as :hover, :active, and :focus to add dynamic styles to your HTML elements. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      .button {
        background-color: lightgray;
        border: none;
        padding: 10px 20px;
        cursor: pointer;
      }

      .button:hover {
        background-color: blue;
        color: white;
      }

      .button:active {
        background-color: darkblue;
      }

      .button:focus {
        outline: none;
        box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px blue;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button class="button">Click Me</button>
  </body>
</html>

In this example, we're using a button element with a class selector of .button to create a simple button.

The .button selector sets the basic style for the button, such as the background color and padding. The .button:hover selector sets the style for when the mouse is hovered over the button, changing the background color to blue and the text color to white.

The .button:active selector sets the style for when the button is being pressed, changing the background color to a darker blue.

The .button:focus selector sets the style for when the button has focus, such as when it is being tabbed to. In this example, we're removing the default outline and adding a blue box shadow to highlight the button.

You can try experimenting with different styles and pseudo-classes to create dynamic and interactive elements on your HTML pages.
