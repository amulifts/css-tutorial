## CSS

CSS stands for **Cascade Style Sheets**. It is a language that is used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG or XHTML). In short, CSS gives web developers the ability to create visually engaging and well-structured websites that are optimized for a wide range of devices and screen sizes.

<a name="history"></a>

## History

CSS was originally developed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie and Bert Bos in 1994. It was originally a proprietary language developed by Netscape for their web browser Netscape Navigator. It was later standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996.

Here's a brief overview of the major versions of HTML:

`CSS 1.0 (1996)` - The first version of CSS was introduced and it provided basic styling capabilities such as font control, text alignment, and background color.

`CSS 2.0 (1998)` - The second version of CSS added support for media types, downloadable fonts support, and improved positioning capabilities.

`CSS 2.1 (2006)` - This version of CSS made minor corrections to the previous version, but it was largely the same.

`CSS 3.0 (1999)` - CSS 3 brought many new features to the table, including rounded corners, shadows, and text shadows, and it also introduced new selectors and media queries. The CSS3 modules were released incrementally and are still in development as of 2023.

It's important to note that while these are the major releases of CSS, there are also minor releases that are released on a regular basis. These minor releases are called **CSS Level 3** and **CSS Level 4**. These are not to be confused with the major releases of CSS, which are called **CSS 3** and **CSS 4**.

### Basic CSS structure

Basic CSS structure refers to the way CSS styles are written and organized in a stylesheet. The basic structure of a CSS stylesheet includes the following components:

- **Selectors** - Selectors are used to target HTML elements in the DOM(Document Object Model). DOM is a tree-like structure that represents the HTML elements in a web page. They are used to select the elements you want to style. Selector can be based on element type (e.g. `h1`, `p`, `div`), class (e.g. `.class-name`), or ID (e.g. `#id-name`).

- **Properties** - Properties defines what aspects of the selected elements you want to change (e.g. `color`, `background-color`, `font-size`)

- **Values** - Values are the actual settings you want to use for the selected properties (e.g. `red`, `blue`, `20px`)

Here's an example of a basic CSS structure:

```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

### CSS Selectors

CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements in the DOM(Document Object Model). DOM is a tree-like structure that represents the HTML elements in a web page. They are used to select the elements you want to style. Selector can be based on element type (e.g. `h1`, `p`, `div`), class (e.g. `.class-name`), or ID (e.g. `#id-name`).

Here are some examples of CSS selectors:

```css
/* Selects all elements of type h1 */
h1 {
    color: red;
}

/* Selects all elements with class name "class-name" */
.class-name {
    color: red;
}

/* Selects all elements with id "id-name" */
#id-name {
    color: red;
}
```

### CSS Box Model

The CSS box model is a concept that describe the layout of HTML elements on a web page. It is made up of the following components:

- **Content** - The content of the box, where text and images appear.

- **Padding** - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.

- **Border** - A border that goes around the padding and content.

- **Margin** - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.
