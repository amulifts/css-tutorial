<!-- CSS transitions and animations are two techniques used to add visual effects and animations to HTML elements on a web page.
While both transitions and animations can create motion and visual interest,
they work in slightly different ways and are best used for different purposes.

<!-- 
    1. CSS transitions allow you to smoothly change the values of a CSS property over a specified duration.
    2. Transitions are triggered by a change in state, such as a hover, click, or focus event,
        and can be applied to almost any CSS property, including position, size, color, and opacity.
    3. To use a transition, you simply specify the property you want to transition, the duration of the transition,
        and any other relevant parameters.

    CSS Transitions:
    1. A transition is a smooth change from one state to another over a specified duration.
    2. Transitions can be applied to almost any CSS property, including color, size, and position.
    3. Transitions are triggered by a change in state, such as a hover or click event.
    4. You can control the speed of a transition using different timing functions, such as ease-in, ease-out, and linear.
    5. Transitions can be used to add subtle visual effects, such as hover effects on buttons or links.
    6. You can apply transitions to pseudo-classes, such as :hover, :focus, and :active.
    7. The transition property accepts multiple values, allowing you to specify different durations and timing functions for different CSS properties.
    8. Transitions can be used to enhance user experience and provide feedback, making a website feel more interactive and engaging.

<!--
    1. CSS animations are more complex than transitions, and allow you to create more intricate and interactive visual effects.
    2. Animations are defined using keyframes, which specify how an element should look at different points in time.

    CSS Animations:
    1. An animation is a more complex visual effect created using a series of keyframes that define how an element should look at different points in time.
    2. CSS animations can be used to create interactive effects, such as loading icons or scrolling animations.
    3. Keyframes define the state of an element at different points in time during the animation, and can include multiple CSS properties.
    4. CSS animations are triggered automatically or by a specific event, such as a hover or click event.
    5. Animations can be controlled using timing functions, just like transitions.
    6. You can use the animation shorthand property to apply an animation to an element, specifying the animation name, duration, timing function, delay, and other parameters.
    7. Animations can be paused, resumed, or canceled using JavaScript, providing more interactivity and control.
    8. CSS animations can be used to create engaging and immersive experiences, adding a layer of interest and interactivity to web pages.
