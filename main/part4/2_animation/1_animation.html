    Animations are similar to transitions, but provide even more control over the animation process, allowing for more complex and dynamic effects.

    Like transitions, CSS animations are created using CSS properties and can be triggered by a variety of events such as hover, click, or page load. Animations also have their own set of properties that control the duration, timing, and keyframes of the animation.

    1. Animation properties:
        These are the CSS properties that define how the animation should look and behave,
        such as animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, and animation-iteration-count.
    2. Keyframes:
        Keyframes are the specific points in an animation sequence where a change in the style of an element occurs.
        These are defined using the @keyframes rule.
    3. Animation-direction:
        This property defines the direction of an animation, such as normal, reverse, alternate, and alternate-reverse.
    4. Animation-fill-mode:
        This property defines what happens to an element before and after an animation is played.
        Values include none, forwards, backwards, and both.
    5. Animation-play-state:
        This property allows you to pause, play, and resume an animation. Values include running and paused.
    6. Animation events:
        CSS animations have a number of events that can be used to trigger JavaScript functions, such as animationstart, animationend, and animationiteration.
    7. Animation libraries:
        There are many animation libraries available that make it easier to create complex animations and add interactivity to them, such as GreenSock, Anime.js, and Velocity.js.
