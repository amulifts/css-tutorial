<!--
    Here's a brief overview of some of the key animation properties you can use:
    
    1. animation-name: This property specifies the name of the keyframe animation that should be applied.
    2. animation-duration: This property sets the length of time that the animation should take to complete.
    3. animation-timing-function: This property determines how the animation progresses through its keyframes. It can be set to values like ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out, among others.
    4. animation-delay: This property specifies how long to wait before starting the animation.
    5. animation-iteration-count: This property sets the number of times the animation should run.
    6. animation-direction: This property sets whether the animation should play forwards, backwards, or alternate back and forth between the two.
    7. animation-fill-mode: This property determines what styles should be applied to the element before and after the animation plays. It can be set to values like forwards, backwards, both, and none.
    8. animation-play-state: This property allows you to pause or resume an animation, or set it to run in slow motion.

    There are also some additional properties that can be used to fine-tune animations, such as animation-delay, animation-iteration-count, and animation-direction.

<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      .box {
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        background-color: blue;
        animation-name: slide;
        animation-duration: 2s;
        animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
        animation-iteration-count: infinite;
        animation-direction: alternate;
      }

      @keyframes slide {
        0% {
          transform: translateX(0);
        }
        50% {
          transform: translateX(100px);
        }
        100% {
          transform: translateX(0);
        }
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="box"></div>
  </body>
</html>

<!--
    The animation-name property is set to slide, which is the name of the keyframe animation that we define later in the CSS.
    The animation-duration property is set to 2s, which means that the animation will last for 2 seconds.
    The animation-timing-function property is set to ease-in-out, which defines the speed curve of the animation. In this case, the animation starts slowly, accelerates through the middle, and slows down again at the end.
    The animation-iteration-count property is set to infinite, which means that the animation will repeat forever.
    The animation-direction property is set to alternate, which means that the animation will alternate between moving to the right and back to the left.
    Finally, we define the slide keyframe animation using the @keyframes rule. This animation moves the box element to the right by 100 pixels and back to its original position over the course of the animation.
