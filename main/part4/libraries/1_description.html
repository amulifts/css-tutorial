    Animation libraries provide a number of benefits, such as
    - simplifying the animation creation process,
    - providing a consistent API for animating across different browsers,
    - and adding extra functionality such as interactivity and easing functions.

    These libraries typically include a range of pre-built animations that can be used out of the box,
    as well as APIs for creating custom animations.
    Some libraries also include advanced features such as timeline-based animations and SVG animation.
