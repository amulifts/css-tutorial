<!-- 
    Transition property accepts 4 values:
        1. Property
            - background-color
            - border
            - border-radius
            - border-shadow
            - color
            - height
            - left
            - opacity
            - padding
            - transform
            - width
            - etc.
        2. Duration - generally time is in seconds
        3. Timing function
            - ease - is like ease-in-out, except it starts slightly faster than it ends.
            - ease-in - will start the transition slowly, and finish at full speed.
            - ease-out - will start the transition at full speed, then finish slowly.
            - ease-in-out - will start slowly, be fastest at the middle of the transition, then finish slowly.
            - linear - will start and finish at the same speed / uses no easing.
            - cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - allows you to define your own timing function.
                - n = 0 to 1
                where n defines the position of the control point on the x-axis.
        4. Delay
