    1. The transition property:
        The transition property is used to specify which CSS properties should be transitioned and how long the transition should take.
            The basic syntax is transition: <property> <duration> <timing-function> <delay>;
        You can also use the shorthand transition property to specify multiple transitions for multiple CSS properties in a single declaration.
    2. Timing functions:
        Timing functions control how the transition progresses over time.
        There are several predefined timing functions available, such as 
            a. ease - the default timing function
            b. ease-in - the transition starts slowly and accelerates as it progresses
            c. ease-out - the transition starts quickly and decelerates as it progresses
            d. ease-in-out - the transition starts slowly, accelerates in the middle, and then decelerates towards the end
            e. linear - the transition occurs at a constant speed throughout
        You can also create custom timing functions using the cubic-bezier() function.
    3. Triggering transitions:
        Transitions can be triggered by various user actions, such as
            a. :hover
            b. :focus
            c. :active
            d. :checked.
        You can also trigger transitions using JavaScript.
    4. Pseudo-classes:
        You can use pseudo-classes, such as
            a. :hover
            b. :focus
            c. :active,
            d. :visited,
        to create more complex transition effects, such as changing the color or opacity of an element on hover.
    5. Multiple transitions:
        You can apply multiple transitions to a single element by using a comma-separated list of values in the transition property.
        Each transition can have its own duration, timing function, and delay.
    6. Transitioning multiple properties:
        You can use the transition property to transition multiple properties at the same time.
        Simply separate the properties with commas.
    7. Multi-step transitions:
        Multi-step transitions use multiple keyframes to create more complex transition effects.
        You can use the @keyframes rule to define a series of keyframes and specify different property values at each step.
    8. Best practices:
        When using transitions, it's important to consider the performance implications, particularly on mobile devices.
        You should also use transitions judiciously, as too many transitions can be distracting and confusing for users.
