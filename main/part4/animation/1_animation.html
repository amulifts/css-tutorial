    1. The animation property:
        The animation property is used to specify the keyframes and other parameters of an animation.
            The basic syntax is animation: <animation-name> <duration> <timing-function> <delay> <iteration-count> <direction> <fill-mode> <play-state>;
        You can also use the shorthand animation property to specify multiple animations for multiple CSS properties in a single declaration.
    2. Keyframes:
        Keyframes define the different states of an animation, including the starting and ending states, as well as any intermediate states.
        You can use the @keyframes rule to define the keyframes for an animation.
    3. Timing functions:
        Timing functions control how the animation progresses over time.
        There are several predefined timing functions available, such as 
            a. ease - the default timing function
            b. ease-in - the transition starts slowly and accelerates as it progresses
            c. ease-out - the transition starts quickly and decelerates as it progresses
            d. ease-in-out - the transition starts slowly, accelerates in the middle, and then decelerates towards the end
            e. linear - the transition occurs at a constant speed throughout
        You can also create custom timing functions using the cubic-bezier() function.
    4. Triggering animations:
        Animations can be triggered by various user actions, such as
            a. :hover
            b. :focus
            c. :active
            d. :checked.
        You can also trigger animations using JavaScript.
    5. Pseudo-classes:
        You can use pseudo-classes, such as
            a. :hover
            b. :focus
            c. :active,
            d. :visited,
        to create more complex animation effects, such as changing the color or opacity of an element on hover.
    6. Multiple animations:
        You can apply multiple animations to a single element by using a comma-separated list of values in the animation property.
        Each animation can have its own duration, timing function, delay, iteration count, direction, fill mode, and play state.
    7. Animation properties:
        There are several other animation properties you can use to control the behavior of an animation, such as
            a. animation-play-state
            b. animation-direction
            c. animation-fill-mode
            d. animation-iteration-count.
    8. Best practices:
        When using animations, it's important to consider the performance implications, particularly on mobile devices.
        You should also use animations judiciously, as too many animations can be distracting and confusing for users.
