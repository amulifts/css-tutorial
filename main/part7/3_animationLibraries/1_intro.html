    Animation libraries are pre-built collections of CSS animations that can be easily added to your website or application. 
    They allow you to create complex animations without having to write all the CSS animation code yourself.

    2. Bounce.js - A powerful JavaScript library that provides a large collection of animations and an easy-to-use API for creating custom animations.
    3. Hover.css - A collection of CSS3 transitions and animations that can be applied to links, buttons, and other HTML elements to create hover effects.
    4. Magic.css - A collection of CSS animations that can be applied to any HTML element to create a variety of effects, such as floating, pulsing,
    
    and so on...

    To use an animation library, you need to include the library's CSS file in your HTML document, and then add the appropriate CSS classes to the HTML elements that you want to animate.
