<!--
    CSS preprocessors, such as Sass, Less, and Stylus, are tools that extend the capabilities of CSS by adding features like:
     - variables - Preprocessors allow you to define variables, which can be used to store values like colors, font sizes, or any other CSS value. This makes it easier to maintain and update your styles, especially when working with large projects.
     - nesting - Preprocessors allow you to nest CSS rules inside each other, making it easier to write and read your code. This also helps to reduce redundancy by grouping related styles together.
     - mixins - Mixins are reusable blocks of code that can be included in multiple places in your CSS. This allows you to define a set of styles once and reuse them throughout your project.
     - functions - Preprocessors allow you to define custom functions that can be used to manipulate values or perform calculations.
     - operators - Preprocessors have additional operators that allow you to perform more complex operations on your CSS values.

    
    Some of the popular CSS preprocessors are:
    1. Sass:
        - Sass is one of the most popular CSS preprocessors, and is known for its powerful features and syntax.
        - Sass uses the .scss or .sass file extension, and can be compiled using a variety of build tools or online services.
    2. Less:
        - Less is a CSS preprocessor that is similar to Sass, but uses a different syntax.
        - Less uses the .less file extension, and can be compiled using a variety of build tools or online services.
    3. Stylus:
        - Stylus is a CSS preprocessor that uses a minimalistic syntax and is known for its speed and ease of use. 
        - Stylus uses the .styl file extension, and can be compiled using a variety of build tools or online services.
