                --> As soon as you add display: flex to an element
                1. It becomes a flex container. 
                    - and all its direct children become flex items
                    - and can be styled with flex properties. 
                
                2. The default layout direction changes.
                    - from horizontal to vertical
                    - By default, flex containers arrange their flex items in a row from left to right.
                    - but you can change the direction to column by adding flex-direction: column;
                    
                3. The flex items become flexible.
                    - By default, flex items are sized according to their content.
                    - but when they become Flex items, they become flexible and can be resized and repositioned using flexbox properties.
                
                4. The alignment and spacing of Flex items can be controlled:
                    - Flexbox provides several properties that can be used to control the alignment and spacing of Flex items,
                    such as justify-content, align-items, and gap.
