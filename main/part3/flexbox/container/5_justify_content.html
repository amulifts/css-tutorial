<!-- 
    Justify content have 5 values:
    1. flex-start: This aligns items to the start of the container's main axis.
    2. flex-end: This aligns items to the end of the container's main axis.
    3. center:  This centers the items along the container's main axis.
    4. space-between: This evenly distributes the items along the main axis, with the first item at the start of the container and the last item at the end of the container.
    5. space-around: This evenly distributes the items along the main axis with equal space on both sides of each item.
    
    Note:
    In Flexbox, the main axis refers to the primary axis along which the flex items are laid out. The direction of the main axis is determined by the flex-direction property.
    For example, if flex-direction is set to row, the main axis is horizontal and runs from left to right. If flex-direction is set to column, the main axis is vertical and runs from top to bottom.

    Change the justify-content property to flex-start, flex-end, center and space-around to see the difference.
