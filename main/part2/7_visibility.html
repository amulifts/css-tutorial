<!-- 
    There are different values for visibility:
    - visible - "visible" means the element is visible on the page and takes up space.
    - hidden - "hidden" means the element is hidden but still takes up space on the page.
    - collapse - "collapse" is used specially for table elements and works similarly to "hidden". However, when used with table elements, "collapse" will remove both the element and any space it would have occupied.
    - initial - "initial" is the default value for the visibility property. It is the same as "visible".
    - inherit - "inherit" means the element will inherit the visibility value from its parent element.
