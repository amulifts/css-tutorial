<!-- Experiment with CSS specificity nature of CSS. Try applying styles using both an id selector and a class selector to the same element, and observe how the styles are combined. -->

<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      /* #my-div {
        color: blue;
      }

      .my-class {
        color: red;
      } */

      /* And Swap */

      .my-class {
        color: red;
      }

      #my-div {
        color: blue;
      }

      /* The result would be the same, because the id selector still has a higher specificity than the class selector. */

    </style>
  </head>
  <div id="my-div" class="my-class">Hello, world!</div>
</html>

<!-- 
In this CSS code, the first style sets the color of the header with an id of "header1" to blue. The second style sets the color of all elements with a class of "text" to green. The third style sets the color of the specific element with both an id of "header1" and a class of "text" to red.

You can observe how the styles are combined and how the specificity of the selectors affects the final styles applied to the elements.
