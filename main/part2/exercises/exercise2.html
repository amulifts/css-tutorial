<!-- Create a HTML page and apply styles using class selectors. Try to create multiple classes with different styles and apply them to different elements on the page. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      .highlight {
        background-color: yellow;
      }

      .bold {
        font-weight: bold;
      }

      .italic {
        font-style: italic;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p class="highlight">This is a paragraph with a yellow background color.</p>
    <p class="bold">This is a bold paragraph.</p>
    <p class="italic">This is an italic paragraph.</p>
    <p class="bold italic">This is a bold and italic paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- 
In this example, we have defined three classes: .highlight, .bold, and .italic. These classes can be applied to any element on the page by using the class attribute. For example, to apply the .highlight class to a p element, we add the class="highlight" attribute to the p tag.

We can also apply multiple classes to the same element. In the last p element, we have applied both the .bold and .italic classes by using class="bold italic".

You can try creating more classes with different styles and apply them to different elements on the page to reinforce your understanding of class selectors.
