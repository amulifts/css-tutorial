<!-- Create a HTML page and apply styles using id selectors. Try to create multiple id's with different styles and apply them to different elements on the page. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      #header {
        background-color: lightgray;
        text-align: center;
        padding: 20px;
      }

      #title {
        color: blue;
        font-size: 36px;
      }

      #subtitle {
        color: green;
        font-size: 24px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="header">
      <h1 id="title">Welcome to my website</h1>
      <p id="subtitle">Here you'll find some interesting content</p>
    </div>
    <p>Here's some content for you to enjoy...</p>
  </body>
</html>
<!-- 
In this example, we have defined three id selectors: #header, #title, and #subtitle. These id selectors can be applied to elements on the page by using the id attribute. For example, to apply the #header id to a div element, we add the id="header" attribute to the div tag.

It's important to note that id selectors should be unique within a page, as an id can only be used once on a page. That means that you can't have multiple elements with the same id on a page.

You can try creating more id selectors with different styles and apply them to different elements on the page to reinforce your understanding of id selectors.
