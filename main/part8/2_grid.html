    Some of the key concept and components of Bootstrap Grid System:
    1. Container:
        - A container is a wrapper element that contains all the grid elements.
        - A container can be created using the .container class.
        - A container can also be created using the .container-fluid class, which creates a full-width container that spans the entire width of the viewport.
    2. Rows:
        - A row is a horizontal group of columns that are used to create a grid layout.
        - A row can be created using the .row class.
    3. Columns:
        - A column is a vertical group of one or more grid cells that are used to create a grid layout.
        - A column can be created using the .col-*-* class, where * represents the breakpoint and * represents the number of columns.
        - A column can also be created using the .col-*-*-* class, where * represents the breakpoint, * represents the number of columns, and * represents the offset.
        - A column can also be created using the .col-*-*-*-* class, where * represents the breakpoint, * represents the number of columns, * represents the offset, and * represents the order.
        - A column can also be created using the .col-*-*-*-*-* class, where * represents the breakpoint, * represents the number of columns, * represents the offset, * represents the order, and * represents the alignment.
    4. Gutters:
        - Gutters are the spaces between the columns.
        - Gutters can be removed using the .no-gutters class.
    5. Breakpoints:
        - Breakpoints are the screen sizes at which the grid layout changes.
        - Bootstrap uses the following breakpoints:
            - Extra small (xs): 0px and up
            - Small (sm): 576px and up
            - Medium (md): 768px and up
            - Large (lg): 992px and up
            - Extra large (xl): 1200px and up 
    6. Column ordering: You can also control the order of columns by using the order class. This allows you to reorder columns on different screen sizes.

    7. Column offsets: To add empty space between columns, you can use the offset class. This allows you to shift columns to the right by a specified number of columns.

    8. Nesting columns: You can also nest columns within columns to create more complex layouts. This is achieved by placing a new row inside a column and then adding additional columns inside the new row.
